# Spice Dispenser GUI
This user interface was designed using tkinter in python. The purpose for this project was to create a prototype from a concept. My team and I chose to make an automatic spice dispenser, and I led the role to develop a user interface so the user can select what spices they would like to add to their recipe. An additional feature that was added was recipe logging so that the user can also choose to keep their most used recipes. A video demonstration of the prototype is available here at https://youtu.be/qhXPNmkCISw, if you would like to see it in action!
